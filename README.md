# st2195_assignment_6

For this assignment we had to download the ECB speeches dataset and the daily EUR/USD reference exchange rate from the ECB Statistical Data Warehouse. Next, save them as “speeches.csv” and “fx.csv”. For the speeches.csv, please keep only the “date” and “contents” columns.

The hiperlinks given were not working: I don't know if I used the correct datasets:
> [ECB speeches](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/html/downloads.en.html)   
> [daily EUR/USD reference exchange rate](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/eurofxref-graph-usd.pt.html)
